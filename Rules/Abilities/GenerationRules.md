# Ability Generation

## Overview

Abilities should have some general rules governing generation. These rules can be broken and should be seen as more of a guidline rather than hard rules. 

Goals:
* Should be simple.
  * Math is fine as long as it is easily understandable
* Should be able to be done on the fly
  * This means that a GM should be able to come up with a cool idea and generate the stats for that ability without consulting the rule book or breaking too long
* The scaling over all levels should be linear.
  * ie. A level 3 vs level 4 vs level 5 should have similar differences
